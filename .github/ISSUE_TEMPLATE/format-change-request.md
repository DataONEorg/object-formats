# Format Metadata

*Provide the metadata to be changed for the format. Note that `formatId` is immutable and can not be changed, and other metadata fields should only be changed to fix errors or clarify intent, and not to change the intent of a format definition. For that, a new format should be proposed.*

- formatName:
- formatType: 
- mediaType :
